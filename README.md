# Order Process Analysis and Prediction
This project aims to analyze and optimize the delivery processes for a Muesli distribution company. The goal is to improve the company's delivery efficiency and provide actionable insights to enhance customer satisfaction.

## Analysis and Models
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Conducted to understand data distribution and identify patterns and anomalies.
### Statistical Testing
A/B testing was used to compare lead times between different processing types.

T-tests were used to evaluate statistical significance of observed differences.
### Machine Learning
Developed a linear regression model to predict lead times based on shipping modes.
